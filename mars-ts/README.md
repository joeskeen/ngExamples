# Mars Hub

Mars Hub is a web app that displays information gathered from Mars rovers, including weather, photos, and Twitter feeds.

## Running the code

This web app requires Node.js and Bower to be installed.  Make sure these are set up and available on the command line before continuing.

From the `mars` directory, run `npm install` and `bower install`.  This will set up your dependencies.

You can then run `node server/server.js` to start your server.  Open your favorite browser to `http://localhost:8634` and you should see the Mars Hub app.
